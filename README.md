# Who I Am and What I Do

<p align="justify">
Hi, I'm glad you're here! Based in Vienna, I mainly focus on CLI-Tools, Neovim, Web Development & Cyber Security. I enjoy experimenting with languages like ZIG, Go, and sometimes Rust, and I also dive into "close to the hardware" topics.

I look forward to any kind of exchange. Feel free to reach out and we can chat on Discord about the wonderful world of information technology!  

**One important note:**  
Access to technology should be a given for everyone, but unfortunately it is not. It is unevenly distributed and, despite its central importance, still not freely accessible. Our data is being collected daily, often without our knowledge or consent, raising critical concerns about privacy and security.
</p>

<p>We must advocate for transparency and control over how our information is used!</p>
